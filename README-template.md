## Overview
it's also a nice challenge , It tests your knowledge on your layout, grid ,flexbox, yeah and a little bit of positioning. A little bit of Javascript, it has a carousel button, menu that you might want to play around with probably animation or something.

## My process
I started out first with a mobile-first workflow. creating the header and adding the nav links to various pages,
moved to main of the site and drop all of it's content first, and afterwards started with the styling after I had written all the HTML codes. For this particular challenge it might have been a mess if I had started out styling just immediately after writing the codes because I had to look out for patterns so I don't keep on repeating styles when they can share class Names, peradventure they needed extra styling I just add another class Name and work based on the styling. Then I wrote the Javascript and moved over to  the styling of the desktop.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Jquery](https://Jquery.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Okay I really got to sharpen my CSS grid and flexbox use.

### Continued development
From what I can see I feel like my grid knowledge is a bit rusty will have to sharpen that up
